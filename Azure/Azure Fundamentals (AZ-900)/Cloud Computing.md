# Cloud Computing

## Define cloud computing

Shared responsibility model

- You and cloud provider share responsibility
- Cloud providers don't take responsibility for everything

## Define cloud models

Public Cloud

- share infrastructure provided by the cloud provider
- multi-tenant provider
- Benefits: agility, quick deployment, easy management, cost control
- Drawbacks: loss of control, security and regulatory requirements, loss of flexibility

Private Cloud

- Benefits: agility, private network dedicated to you, can be used without internet, can help control costs
- Drawbacks: if infrastructure is owned costs can be high, may noty be able control access to data

Hybrid Cloud

- Benefits: keep some systems on-premises, better support for legacy systems, maintain control over data and infrastructure
- Drawbacks: complex to connect systems, compatibility of data, additional IT expertise required

## Consumption-Based Model

- Pay only for resources allocated to you
  - Don't allocate more resources than you need
  - ensure you utilize the resource allocated
