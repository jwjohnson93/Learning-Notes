# Benefits of Cloud Computing

## High Availability and Scalability

Availability

- An application and the systems is uses are accessible by users
  - What makes and app unavailable?
    - network outage, app failure, system outage, power outage

Scalability

- Vertical scaling: scale up or down as needed
- Horizontal scaling: scale out - adding more VMs/resources

## Reliability and Predictability

Fault Tolerance

- Fault occurs when a failure happens
- Fault tolerance - maintain availability when a fault happens

Disaster Recovery

- Disasters are large-scale events
- More impactful than a fault
- Business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR)

## Security and Governance

Security

- restricts access to your resources to only those you allow

Governance

- Refers to the level of access that someone has, what they can do, and how they can do it

## Manageability in the Cloud

- Monitor your resources
- Scale resources
- Budget what you spend
- Easily deploy and manage resources
